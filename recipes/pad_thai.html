    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by soaking the rice noodles in lukewarm water for about 30 minutes. You can also quickly pre-boil the noodles for about 4-5 minutes, then rinse them in cold water and let them drain in a strainer. However, i recommend soaking them for the best texture on the noodles.</li>
        <li>Rinse the bean sprouts. Mix all the indredients for the sauce in a bowl and set aside. Chop the chicken and tofu into pieces. Finely chop the peanuts. Now you have all the preparations ready, time to roll up your sleeves and start to wok! </li>
        <li>Heat oil in a wok or frying pan. Fry the chicken until browned. Stir in the tofu, fry a little longer. If necessary, add more oil if it feels dry. Push the tofu and chicken aside in the frying pan and crack in the eggs,fry the eggs while stirring until you get scrambled eggs. Then mix the eggs with the chicken. Strain the noodles thoroughly and turn them into the frying pan, pour over the sauces and mix everything thoroughly. Fry the noodles while stirring until they soften. Stir and taste, if necessary add more soy/fish sauce/oyster sauce/sugar.</li>
        <li>Stir in the bean sprouts. Also turn in the peanuts now or have it as garnish when serving. Mix everything together and turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Serve with lime, chiliflakes and coriander.</li>
